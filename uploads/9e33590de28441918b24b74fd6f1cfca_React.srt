00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,359
Developed at Facebook and released in 2013, it's safe to say React has been the most influential

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:10,279
UI library of recent memory.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:14,759
We use it to build components that represent logical, reusable parts of the UI.

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,719
The beauty of React is that the simplicity of building a component has been brought down

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,280
to its theoretical minimum.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,080
It's just a JavaScript function.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,320
It's so easy, a caveman could do it.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,199
The return value from this function is your HTML or UI, which is written in a special syntax

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,719
called JSX, allowing you to easily combine JavaScript with HTML markup.

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,439
If you want to pass data into a component, you simply pass at a props argument, which

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,280
you can then reference inside the function body or in the UI using braces.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,200
If the value changes, React will react to update the UI.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,960
If we want to give our component its own internal state, we can use the state hook.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,280
The hook is just a function that returns a value as well as a function to change the

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
value.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,159
In this case, count is our reactive state and set count will change the state.

18
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,159
When used in the template, the count will always show the library for building for building for building for building for user interfaces for user interfaces.

19
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:14,159
The reason you might want to use React is not the library itself, but the massive ecosystem that surrounds it.

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,159
React itself doesn't care about routing, state management, animation or anything like that.

21
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,159
Instead, it lets those concerns evolve naturally within the open source community.

22
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
No matter what you're trying to do, there's very likely a good supporting library to help you get it done.

23
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,159
Need a static site, you have Gatsby.

24
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,159
Need server-side rendering, you have Next.

25
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
For animation, you have Spring. For forms, you have Formic.

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,159
State management, you've got Redux, MobEx, Flux, Recoil, XState and more.

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,159
You have an endless supply of choices to get things done the way you like it.

28
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
As an added bonus, once you have React down, you can easily jump into React Native and start building mobile apps.

29
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,159
And it's no surprise that knowing this little UI library is one of the most
